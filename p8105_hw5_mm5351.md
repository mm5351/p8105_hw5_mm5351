**Problem 1**

``` r
iris_fill = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

output = map_df(iris_with_missing, iris_fill) 
```

**Problem 2**

``` r

participant = list.files(path = "./Data", pattern = ".csv",  all.files = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)) %>%

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of Î²1 on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.
