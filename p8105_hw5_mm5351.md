**Problem 1**

``` r
iris_fill = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
    replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

output = map_df(iris_with_missing, iris_fill) 
```

**Problem 2**

``` r
study_df = tibble(
participant = list.files(path = "./Data", pattern = ".csv",  all.files = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(participant, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
